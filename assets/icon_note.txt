For a complete implementation, you would need to create the following icon files:

1. icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
2. icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can generate these icons using the create_icons.html file included in the project.
Open this file in a browser, then click the "Download Icons" button to generate the icons.
Move the downloaded icons to the assets folder.

Alternatively, you can create icons using any image editing software like GIMP, Photoshop, or online tools.

For testing purposes, you can also use placeholder icons from browser extension development resources.
