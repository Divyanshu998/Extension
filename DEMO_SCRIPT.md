# PhishGuard AI: 30-Second Demo Script

## Setup Requirements

- Chrome or Edge browser with the extension installed
- A legitimate banking website (e.g., chase.com)
- A simulated phishing website (for demo purposes only)

## Demo Script

### [0:00-0:05] Introduction
"Today I'm demonstrating PhishGuard AI, a browser extension that uses artificial intelligence to detect phishing websites in real-time. This extension combines on-device machine learning with cloud-based models to provide fast and accurate protection."

### [0:05-0:10] Extension Overview
*[Show browser with extension icon]*
"The extension runs in the background, continuously monitoring websites you visit. It analyzes URLs, page content, and visual elements to identify potential threats."

### [0:10-0:15] Safe Website Example
*[Navigate to a legitimate banking website]*
"When visiting legitimate sites like this banking portal, PhishGuard shows a green status, indicating the site is safe. The extension has verified the domain age, SSL certificate, and content patterns."

### [0:15-0:20] Phishing Website Detection
*[Navigate to a simulated phishing site]*
"Now, let's visit a simulated phishing site that mimics a popular bank login page. This site was created for demonstration purposes only."

### [0:20-0:25] Warning System
*[Show warning banner appearing]*
"Notice how PhishGuard immediately displays a red warning banner, alerting you to the potential threat. The extension detected multiple risk factors in just milliseconds using its on-device neural network."

### [0:25-0:30] Explainability Features
*[Click 'View Details' and show side panel]*
"Clicking 'View Details' shows exactly why this site was flagged - suspicious domain age, mismatched SSL certificate, and hidden elements in the page code. This transparency helps users understand and trust the AI's decision."

### [0:30-0:35] Conclusion
"PhishGuard combines on-device and cloud AI models to achieve 96% detection accuracy while maintaining your privacy and browsing speed. It's a practical application of AI for everyday security that could prevent thousands of phishing attacks."

## Key Points to Emphasize

1. **Real-time protection**: Detection happens in milliseconds during page loading
2. **Hybrid approach**: Combines fast on-device models with accurate cloud models
3. **Explainability**: Clear visualization of risk factors and detection confidence
4. **User experience**: Non-intrusive design with actionable security information
5. **Technical innovation**: Implementation of state-of-the-art ML techniques in a browser extension

## Demo Tips

- Practice the timing to ensure a smooth 30-second presentation
- Have all websites pre-loaded in different tabs for quick switching
- Consider recording a backup video in case of technical issues
- Be prepared to explain how the AI models work if asked follow-up questions
